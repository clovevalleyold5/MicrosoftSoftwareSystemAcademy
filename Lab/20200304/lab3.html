		<h2>Button</h2>

			text<br/>
			<textarea rows = "4" cols = "40" name = "textarea" id = "textarea" onfocus = "textarea.value = '';">

		<div style = "font-style : oblique; text-align : right">
			<p style = "font-family: serif;">
			I have followed the <span style = "color : red;">most</span> commonly used unit testing style in this chapter, in which an application
			feature is written and then tested to make sure it works as required. This is popular because most
			<span style = "text-decoration : underline;">developers</span> think about application code first and testing comes second (this is certainly the category
			that I fall into).</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Header2</h2>
		<div style = "font-style : normal; text-align : center">
			<p style = "font-family: monospace;">
			The <span style = "font-weight : 800"> problem</span> with this approach is that it tends to produce unit tests that focus only on the parts of
			the application code that were <span style = "text-decoration : line-through;">difficult</span> to write or that needed some serious debugging, leaving some
			aspects of a feature only partially tested or untested altogether.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Header3</h2>
		<div style = "font-style : italic;">
			<p style = "font-family: cursive;">
			An alternative approach is <span style = "font-size : 18pt;">Test-Driven Development (TDD)</span>. There are lots of variations on TDD, but
			the core idea is that you write the tests for a feature before implementing the feature itself. Writing the
			tests first makes you think <span style = "text-decoration : blink;">more</span> carefully about the specification you are implementing and how you
			will know that a feature has been implemented correctly. Rather than diving into the implementation
			detail, TDD makes you consider what the measures of success or failure will be in advance.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Header4</h2>
			<p>
			<span style = "text-transform : capitalize;">The tests that you write will all fail initially because your new feature will not be implemented. But as
			you add code to the application, your tests will gradually move from red to green and all of your tests
			will pass by the time that the feature is complete. TDD requires discipline, but it does produce a more
			comprehensive set of tests and can lead to more robust and reliable code.</span>
